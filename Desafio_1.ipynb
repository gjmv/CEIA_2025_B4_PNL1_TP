Prayerfully reflecting on the<br>truth of Mary's sinlessness, and the means by which God could have<br>achieved this, the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate<br>Conception.  Thus, the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine,<br>but the logical result of our understanding of two old ones.<br><br>The celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was<br>given by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84) and the Feast was made a precept<br>feast of the Church by Pope Clement XI (1700-21).<br><br><br>No.  First of all, Lourdes is private revelation, and doctrine is not<br>based on private revelation.  The most that private revelation can do<br>is enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation,<br>which ended with the death of St. John the Apostle.<br><br>Second, the \"case for the doctrine\" was irreformably sealed in 1854 <br>with the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull \"Ineffabilis Deus\" by<br>Pope Pius IX.  This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as<br>a dogma; a dogma, by definition, cannot change and is required to be<br>believed by the faithful.<br><br>The apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858, four years later.  The most<br>that might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation<br>of 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval, but the Church has never<br>claimed that, nor shall she.<br><br>In Christ's Peace,<br><br>Brad Kaiser<br>(bradk@isdgsm.eurpd.csg.mot.com)</td>\n",

However, I was simply commenting on the charge that<br>it is an \"incredibly perverse\" interpretation to read this as a<br>condemnation of homosexuality.  Such a charge seems to imply that no<br>reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul<br>intended to condemn homosexuality; however, I think I can see how a<br>reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse.<br>Therefore I do not believe it is \"incredibly perverse\" to read it in<br>this way.<br><br><br>Actually, I wasn't thinking of the church at all.  After all, a couple<br>doesn't have to be married by a minister.  A secular justice of the<br>peace could do the job, and the two people would be married.  My point<br>was that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual<br>marriage, but where in the Bible would one get a Christian marriage<br>between two people of the same sex?  And if you do see a biblical<br>basis for same-sex marriages, how willing would gay Christians be to<br>\"save themselves\" for such a marriage and to never have sexual<br>intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship?  Please<br>note that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be<br>willing to be so monogamous, I am genuinely interested in hearing<br>opinions on the subject.  I have heard comments from gays in the past<br>that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main<br>points of being homosexual, yet I tend to doubt that gays who want to<br>be Christian would advocate such a position.
